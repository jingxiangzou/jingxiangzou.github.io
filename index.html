                <p>
                    Greetings! My name is Jingxiang Zou and I am currently a graduate student at Boston University's math finance program. You can download my resume <a href="assets/my_resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
                    I was born in Nanchang, Jiangxi on Mar 21st, 2000. Prior to my graduate journey here at BU, I studied at Tongji University, majoring in applied mathematics and finance, from which I obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematical finance.<br><br>
                    My past internships include roles at Haitong Securities (2023), GF Securities (2021), and China Merchant Bank (2020). During my summer internship at the Derivative Product and Trading Dept. of Haitong Securities, I conducted research related to derivative pricing and hedging. You can find more details on the 'My Work' page of this website.<br><br>
                    Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy teaching and have tutored students in high school math and TOEFL English. My long-term goal is to become a professor in finance and mathematical finance, and I'm actively working towards securing a Ph.D. position for the fall of 2024.

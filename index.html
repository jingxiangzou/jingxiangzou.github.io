        <p>
            I was born in Nanchang, Jiangxi on Mar 21st, 2000. Prior to my graduate journey here at BU, I studied in Tongji Univerisity majoring in applied mathematics and finance from which I got a bachelor's degree in math finance.

        <p>
            I have been exposed to extensive practice in my past internships in Haitong Securities (2023), GF Securities(2021) and China Merchant Bank(2020). During my summer internship at the Derivative Product and Trading Dept. of Haitong Securities, I conducted researches pertaining to derivative pricing and hedging. They are elaborated in the 'My Work' page of this website.

            I enjoying spending time to solve questions that interest me in my own space and time, and I enjoy teaching. I have been working as a part-time teacher every now and then. In the summer of 2018, I tutored a student high school math(arts student). I taught high school math(science student) over the spring of 2020 in Nanchang. As of now I am teaching TOEFL English courses to one of my alumi from Tongji University which is so far the best teaching experience I have.

            For the reasons above, I see myself as a professor in finance & math finance in the next decade and I am actively working to secure a Ph.D. position commencing at fall of 2024.

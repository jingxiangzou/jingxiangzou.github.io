        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Greetings! My name is Jingxiang Zou, and I am currently a graduate student at Boston University's math finance program. I was born in Nanchang, Jiangxi on Mar 21st, 2000. I studied applied mathematics and finance at Tongji University and earned a bachelor's degree in math finance.
        </p>

        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I've been fortunate to have interned at esteemed institutions such as Haitong Securities, GF Securities, and China Merchant Bank. My work in the Derivative Product and Trading Dept. of Haitong Securities focused on derivative pricing and hedging.
        </p>

        <h3>Teaching Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about teaching. Over the years, I've tutored students in high school math and have taught TOEFL English courses. I cherish these experiences, as they've deepened my understanding of the subjects and the joy of imparting knowledge.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
        <p>
            I envision myself as a professor in finance & mathematical finance in the coming decade and am actively seeking a Ph.D. position starting in the fall of 2024.

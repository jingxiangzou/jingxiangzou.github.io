        <h2>A new ETF evalution system</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Abstract: In the report, we adopt multiple measures to evaluate tracking errors based on recent data and
evaluate fund liquidity as represented by volume and a special gauge of bid-ask spread proposed
by Lyxor Asset Management. Based on tracking error metrics and liquidity gauges, we propose an
ETF efficiency indicator that can be used to choose the optimal ETF for trading purpose</li>

        <h2>CDS: A probabilistic Understanding</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>    Jingxiang Zou delves into a probabilistic understanding of the Credit Default Swap (CDS) pricing formula. This paper postulates that a credit event can occur at any random moment within a defined timeframe (t0, tN). The study employs probability density functions to model the likelihood of credit events at specific times and equates this to changes in the probability that a credit event does not occur. A mathematical approach is used to derive the protection leg of the CDS pricing formula, emphasizing the importance of expected loss and recovered value rates. The paper then explores the more intricate premium leg, distinguishing between realized and unrealized premium payments. The author likens the CDS to insurance, suggesting that the "fair" price is one where expected premiums equal expected payouts. The foundational principle of this work is that the expected cash flows from premiums and credit events, when discounted, should be equal.
